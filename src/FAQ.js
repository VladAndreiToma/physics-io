            topic: "What makes laser light special?",
            explanation: "Laser light consists of photons that are coherent, meaning their wavefunctions propagate synchronously in time and space. They share the same wave vector and phase, leading to constructive interference and significant amplification of the light signal's amplitude. Additionally, laser photons have identical wavelength and frequency, producing a monoenergetic and monochromatic beam. Although no laser is perfect, deviations from these ideal parameters are minimal."
        },
        {
            topic: "What is quantum entanglement?",
            explanation: "Quantum entanglement links two or more particles so their quantum states cannot be described independently. Measuring one instantly determines the state of the other, regardless of distance. This nonlocal correlation defies classical intuition but does not enable faster-than-light communication. Entangled particles share correlated properties like spin or polarization, crucial for quantum computing and cryptography."
        },
        {
            topic: "What does the Heisenberg uncertainty principle mean?",
            explanation: "This principle states it is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of a particle with perfect accuracy. Increasing precision in measuring one property inherently increases uncertainty in the other due to the wave-like nature of particles and the limits of quantum mechanics."
        },
        {
            topic: "What is quantum superposition?",
            explanation: "Quantum particles exist in a superposition of multiple states simultaneously until measured. Their wavefunction encodes probabilities for each state, and upon measurement, the system 'collapses' into one definite state. Superposition enables quantum parallelism essential in quantum computing."
        },
        {
            topic: "What is wave-particle duality?",
            explanation: "Particles such as electrons and photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior depending on the experiment. This duality challenges classical physics, showing entities behave like waves in some contexts and like particles in others."
        },
        {
            topic: "What is Schr√∂dinger's cat thought experiment?",
            explanation: "A thought experiment illustrating superposition and measurement in quantum mechanics. A cat in a sealed box is simultaneously alive and dead until observed, highlighting how quantum states depend on observation."
        },
        {
            topic: "What is the theory of relativity?",
            explanation: "Einstein's theory shows that space and time are relative, changing with the observer's velocity. It unifies space and time into spacetime and introduces phenomena like time dilation and length contraction at speeds near light."
        },
        {
            topic: "What are black holes?",
            explanation: "Black holes are regions where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. They form from collapsed massive stars and are described by event horizons beyond which information cannot return."
        },

        },
        {
            topic: "What is dark energy?",
            explanation: "A mysterious form of energy causing the accelerated expansion of the universe, counteracting gravity on cosmic scales."

            topic: "What is the photoelectric effect?",
            explanation: "The emission of electrons from a material when exposed to light of sufficient frequency. It demonstrates the particle nature of light and was pivotal in quantum theory development."

        {
            topic: "What is the Pauli exclusion principle?",
