    title: `
Introduction to Semiconductors`,
    markdown: `
Semiconductors are materials with electrical conductivity between conductors and insulators. Their behavior is strongly influenced by temperature, impurities (dopants), and external fields.

- Intrinsic semiconductors: Pure materials like silicon or germanium
- Extrinsic semiconductors: Doped with impurities to alter carrier concentrations
- Conductivity depends on thermal excitation of electrons from valence to conduction band
- Applications span from diodes and transistors to LEDs and solar cells

    title: `
Band Theory of Solids`,
    markdown: `
Electrons in solids occupy energy bands. The energy gap (band gap) between valence and conduction bands determines the material's electrical properties.

- Conductors: Overlapping valence and conduction bands
- Insulators: Wide band gap, electrons cannot jump easily
- Semiconductors: Moderate band gap (~0.6 to 3 eV)
- Effective mass approximation and density of states
- Fermi level position determines carrier population

    title: `
Charge Carriers and Carrier Dynamics`,
    markdown: `
Charge carriers in semiconductors are electrons and holes.

- Drift: Motion due to applied electric field
- Diffusion: Motion due to concentration gradients
- Mobility: Measure of how easily carriers move
- Recombination: Electron-hole pairs annihilate, releasing energy
- Generation: Creation of pairs by thermal excitation or light absorption
- Continuity equation and carrier lifetime
`

    title: `
Doping and Carrier Concentration`,
    markdown: `
Doping adds impurity atoms to control electrical properties.

- N-type: Add donor atoms (extra electrons)
- P-type: Add acceptor atoms (holes)
- Ionization energy and full activation at room temperature
- Fermi level shifts closer to conduction band (n-type) or valence band (p-type)
- Carrier concentration is temperature and doping dependent

    title: `
PN Junctions and Diode Operation`,
    markdown: `
When p-type and n-type materials are joined, a PN junction is formed.

- Depletion region: Zone with immobile ionized dopants
- Built-in potential: Internal electric field at the junction
- Forward bias: Reduces barrier, current flows
- Reverse bias: Increases barrier, very small leakage current
- Current-voltage characteristics modeled by Shockley equation
- Breakdown mechanisms: Zener and avalanche

    title: `
Optoelectronic Devices`,
    markdown: `
Semiconductors can emit or absorb light based on energy transitions.

- LEDs: Forward-biased PN junctions emit light via recombination
- Laser diodes: Stimulated emission and optical feedback
- Photodiodes: Light absorption generates electron-hole pairs
- Solar cells: Convert absorbed photons into current
- Quantum efficiency and responsivity
- Materials must match the band gap to the desired photon energy
