            markdown: `
            Generalized coordinates are a set of independent variables used to describe the configuration of a system. These coordinates are not necessarily the usual Cartesian ones. For example, in a pendulum, instead of using x and y coordinates, the angle θ may serve as a generalized coordinate.

            The speed of a generalized coordinate is its time derivative:
            ẋᵢ = dqᵢ/dt

            The generalized acceleration is the second time derivative:
            ẍᵢ = d²qᵢ/dt²

            Generalized momenta are defined as the partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to generalized velocities:
            pᵢ = ∂L/∂ẋᵢ

            They generalize the classical notion of momentum and are essential in both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics.

            Phase space is the space of all possible states of a system, typically described by positions and momenta. For a system with n generalized coordinates, the phase space has 2n dimensions.

            Each point in phase space represents a complete state of the system:

            The Lagrangian is defined as the difference between kinetic energy T and potential energy V:
            L = T - V

            The motion is determined using the Euler-Lagrange equations:
            d/dt (∂L/∂ẋᵢ) - ∂L/∂qᵢ = 0

            These are second-order differential equations governing the system’s dynamics.

            Lagrangian mechanics is often more convenient for systems with constraints and when using generalized coordinates.

            Liouville’s theorem states that phase-space volume is conserved in a Hamiltonian system.

            The flow in phase space preserves volume:
            dΩ/dt = 0

            This implies that the probability distribution in phase space remains constant over time.

            Noether’s theorem links symmetries of a system to conservation laws.

            - Space translation symmetry → Momentum conservation  
            - Rotational symmetry → Angular momentum conservation
