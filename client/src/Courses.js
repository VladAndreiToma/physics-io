Topics include stimulated and spontaneous emission, Einstein coefficients, population inversion, and line broadening effects. Students will explore optical, electrical, and chemical pumping mechanisms such as those used in Nd:YAG, COâ‚‚, and dye lasers. The course covers types of lasersâ€”solid-state, gas, dye, fiber, semiconductor, and free-electronâ€”detailing their operating principles, gain media, and emission characteristics. Core design aspects include optical resonators, Fabryâ€“PÃ©rot cavities, Gaussian beam propagation, transverse modes, and cavity stability conditions.
                        Beam shaping, mode locking, Q-switching, and pulse characterization are introduced. Applications span industrial cutting, spectroscopy, optical communication, and precision metrology. Safety classifications (Class 1 to 4), protective measures, and compliance with international laser safety standards are emphasized. Engineering aspects include thermal management, driver design, system modeling, and optical alignment. The course concludes with advanced topics like nonlinear optics (e.g. SHG), ultrafast lasers, CPA, and high-intensity laserâ€“plasma interactions, preparing students for real-world system design and high-tech applications."
