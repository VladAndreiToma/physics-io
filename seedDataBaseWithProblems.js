Use the first derivative to find the critical points and the second derivative to classify them.",solution: "To find the critical points of the function \\( f(x) = x^5 - 5x^3 + 4x \\), we first compute its derivative \\( f'(x) = 5x^4 - 15x^2 + 4 \\). Setting this equal to zero gives the equation \\( 5x^4 - 15x^2 + 4 = 0 \\). Dividing both sides by 5 yields \\( x^4 - 3x^2 + 0.8 = 0 \\). Let \\( u = x^2 \\), so the equation becomes \\( u^2 - 3u + 0.8 = 0 \\). Using the quadratic formula: \\( u = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 - 4 \\cdot 0.8}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 - 3.2}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{5.8}}{2} \\).

Compute partial derivatives: ∂f/∂x = 2x + y and ∂f/∂y = x + 2y. Set both equal to zero: 2x + y = 0 and x + 2y = 0. Solving the system, multiply second equation by 2: 2x + 4y = 0. Subtract first equation: (2x + 4y) - (2x + y) = 0 → 3y = 0 → y=0. Substitute back to 2x + 0 = 0 → x=0. So critical point at (0,0). To classify, evaluate Hessian matrix: [[2,1],[1,2]].
